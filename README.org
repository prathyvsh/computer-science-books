* Understanding Functional Programming
Books to learn functional programming thoroughly

This is a list of computer science books that [[https://twitter.com/][we]] have compiled after searching in this field for around 8 years now. We have featured the books by gathering opinions from different sources on the Internet, then researching the authors, going through the index and skimming through the books ourselves. Even after being in the field for close to a decade, we have barely read any of these books. We wanted to change that situation and to learn this, we choose to learn these topics from the best books in the field, so we have try to put some effort into the research since we felt it should be useful first for ourselves, then for posterity. We would love to hear from you if we have missed any must reads or hidden gems that would aid us in our journey! [[https://twitter.com/prathyvsh][Tweet to us]] if you know about one.

** Selection Criteria

** Notes

Most sites on the internet suggest to get going with SICP. But for a newcomer, that book is hard. We have personally tried to get going through the book, but we had to put it down twice, finish a few other primers first before tackling it again. So, we wouldn't really recommend it as the first one to tackle.

HtDP is a beginner level introduction to the world of functional programming. Fairly easy book to go through (apart from that tough nut 12.4.1 exercise in the first edition) and rewarding of the effort you put into it.
